# Magento 2 Backend Reindex

Backend Reindex extension is a powerful tool to refresh connection data of the product, stock, inventory, etc. There is no need to use any command line. The admin can run the complete reindexing with a few clicks. The admin can reindex the selected data of his choice or the admin can reindex all data from the admin Index Management Grid. Thus, the admin can save much time with some clicks from the backend. It can improve the customerâ€™s shopping experience as the latest data is delivered to them as soon as possible. With a well-organized grid, all the indexation processes and data status are visible in the admin Index Management Grid so that the admin can easily track them.

In the default Magento 2, admins can only reindex data by using command lines as the reindex feature is disabled in the backend. Hence, the extension is developed to be an effective solution to this problem. The reindex action is now enabled in Index Management at the backend. Admins are free to reindex the data at any time. In addition, it is an ideal tool to save time for admin in the process of managing the Magento 2 backend.
